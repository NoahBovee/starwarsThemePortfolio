TO DO!!!!

- remove filter: work with main.htlm as just one big nav menu, all nav li's lead to entire new html file 
=> nav menu idea: 1 column, 4 links underneath each other with sliding background-color hover effect

- resume img should me modal // don't use picture, write experiences etc...

- slightly pimp projects (add react project) // instead of a grid, maybe just one column with some
more text explaining the project

- links to github!!

- nice to add: spaceships flying around in background // make small game out of the contact cards: 
ex. all the cards move around and bounce against window's border, shoot / click it to destroy and see




- responsiveness!!



DONE????

- pimping contact cards -> more star wars theme? maybe characters on the back 
- button in projects and resume to activate overflowY

DONE!!!!

- make sure text in "i" section is hidden till the button is pressed  CHECK
